It's called liq sweep but it's just a personal attack to you.

There can't be optimization over rich guys hunting you. 

The 'sweep' in which institutional investors and market makers temporarily break through major support/resistance lines to secure liquidity induces the loss of ant investors. Sweep is the act of forcing the mathematical model to inject unpredictable abnormal noise. Mathematically, this is an outlier that distorts the distribution of data, and nonlinear models learned including this inevitably fall into the trap of **overfitting. In other words, yesterday's correct answer is today's incorrect answer because the market is constantly generating noise and twisting the shape of the function. If trading is defined as a nonlinear optimization problem, the goal we should pursue is not the 'point to make 100% profit'. Instead, we should focus on a probabilistic model that maximizes the expected value ($E$) amid uncertainty.

This formula is the only compass for trading. Even if the win rate ($Win\Rate$) is reduced due to the noise of sweep, the overall expected value can be kept positive ($+$) by adjusting the profit and loss ratio ($Avg\Win / Avg\ Loss$. If optimization is the act of finding a 'point', expected value management is the act of securing the 'area'.

"Robustness" rather than "mathematical perfection" The conclusion that nonlinear optimization is not possible gives traders freedom, not despair. This is because instead of adjusting the number by 0.1 to find the perfect entry price, it creates a robust system that does not collapse easily under any noise (sweep).
